## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
```

In the book you will also learn important python libraries like KERAS for Deep Learning and OpenCV for computer vision in detail. All codes are tested on latest Anaconda environment (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) with python 3.7 on Windows 16 GB laptop. It is recommended to use laptop with more than 8GB. You can also use Google Colab if you would like to execute the code in platform independent environment. You need to install below libraries:

1. Tensorflow Installation:  https://www.tensorflow.org/install
2. Keras Installation:  https://keras.io/
3. Pandas Installation:  https://pandas.pydata.org/
4. Numpy Installation:  https://numpy.org/
5. OpenCV Installation:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51853018/how-do-i-install-opencv-using-pip/56315658

**Note:** You can directly install Anaconda environment as it will install most of the datascience packages at once: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Any additional installation instructions and information the user needs for getting set up. 

For few of the chapter you need to install few files and put in folder provides, please find the details below:

Chapter 3 to 6: No download required

Chapter 7: Download link is provided in folder “traffic-signs-data”, download the file and put in “traffic-signs-data”

Chapter 8-9: No Download required

Chapter 10: download link is provided in “beta_simulator_windows” and “track” folder. Download the files and put in these folders.

Chapter 11: download link can be found in “data” folder.
